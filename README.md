# DNA_SEQUENCE_MATCHING_SUFFIX_TREE
-The problem of DNA subsequence matching is formulated as follows :
Given a DNA database S, a query sequence Q and a tolerance T, the
problem is to find a subsequence S’ of S whose dissimilarity with some
subsequence Q’ of Q is not larger than T.

-The suffix trie has been known to be a good index structure for DNA subsequence
matching. The suffix tree is a compressed digital trie built on all the suffixes of given
sequences. The suffix tree shows reasonable performance in finding all the matched
subsequences.
